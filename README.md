Extraction and Analysis of data from F-Droid

In this study, we present a study of testing culture in mobile app developers. To get an insight on the test automation culture, we conduct two different studies. In the first study, we analyse over 600 Android apps collected from F-Droid, one of the largest
repositories containing information about open-source Android apps. We check for the presence of test cases and calculate code
coverage to measure the adequacy of testing in these apps. We also survey developers who have hosted their applications on
GitHub to understand the testing practices followed by them. We ask developers about the tools that they use and “pain points”
that they face while testing Android apps. For the second study, based on the responses from Android developers, we improve our
survey questions and resend it to Windows app developers within Microsoft.
